# Genetic algorithms

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search-based optimization technique based on the principles of Genetics and Natural Selection. 
It is frequently used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems which otherwise would take a lifetime
 o solve. It is frequently used to solve optimization problems, in research, and in machine learning.

### Introduction to optimization

Optimization is the process of making something better. 

Optimization refers to finding the values of inputs in such a way that we get the “best” output values. The definition 
of “best” varies from problem to problem, but in mathematical terms, it refers to maximizing or minimizing one or more 
objective functions, by varying the input parameters.

The set of all possible solutions or values which the inputs can take make up the search space. In this search space, 
lies a point or a set of points which gives the optimal solution. The aim of optimization is to find that point or set 
of points in the search space.
